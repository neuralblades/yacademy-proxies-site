# yAcademy Proxies Research

In Web3, the **Proxy** or **Proxy Delegate** is a [delegation pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern) commonly used to introduce upgradability in smart contracts. While it can be extremely *powerful*, it is also *commonly misunderstood* â€” leading to incorrect implementations and security issues. 

This research effort compiles proxy knowledge with the goal of improving the correctness of proxy implementations and providing a useful resource for security reviews of proxy contracts. By sharing knowledge, we hope to improve the security of smart contracts and the greater ecosystem.
